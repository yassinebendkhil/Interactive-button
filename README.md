Key Features
Hover Effect:

When the user hovers over the box, it smoothly scales up and changes its background color from blue to red. This effect is achieved using CSS transitions.

Click-Triggered Animations:

A button labeled "Click Me!" allows users to toggle between two animations:

Spin Animation: The box rotates 360 degrees continuously in a smooth, looping motion.

Bounce Animation: The box moves up and down in a bouncing motion, creating a playful effect.

These animations are defined using CSS @keyframes and activated dynamically using JavaScript.

Responsive Design:

The page is centered both vertically and horizontally, ensuring it looks great on any screen size.

Clean and Modern UI:

The design is minimalistic, with a focus on the interactive elements. The use of subtle transitions and animations enhances the user experience without overwhelming the interface.

How It Works
HTML: Provides the structure of the page, including the box, button, and heading.

CSS: Handles the styling, hover effects, and defines the animations using @keyframes.

JavaScript: Adds interactivity by toggling animation classes on the box when the button is clicked.

Purpose
This project demonstrates how to:

Create smooth animations using CSS @keyframes.

Use JavaScript to dynamically add or remove CSS classes for interactivity.

Combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a responsive and engaging webpage.

Potential Use Cases
Learning tool for beginners to understand animations and interactivity.

A starting point for more complex interactive designs (e.g., games, portfolios, or landing pages).

Showcasing UI/UX design principles with animations.
